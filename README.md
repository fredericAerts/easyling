### Remarks

While reviewing this app, please keep in mind that this is my first encounter with the Dart language.

### Getting Started

#### 1. Git clone this project:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/fredericJos/easyling.git
```

#### 2. In terminal, navigate to [app](Task#2/app/) folder

#### 3. Download packages:

```sh
$ pub get
```

#### 3. Run app:

```sh
$ dart bin/main.dart
```

The results of running the predicates against each Shape instance should now have been written to stdout.

#### 3. Run tests:

```sh
$ pub run test
```
